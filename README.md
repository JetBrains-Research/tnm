## How to use

### CLI
Run `./gradlew :installDist` (`build.sh` script) to create script for creating 
execution scripts in `./build/install/technical-connections/bin/` directory.

Then depending on your platform execute script from `build/install/technical-connections/bin/`.
For windows, it will be `*.bat` and second one for others (run.sh).
